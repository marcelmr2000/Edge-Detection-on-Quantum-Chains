# Edge-Detection-on-Quantum-Chains

This Repository contains all the necessary code to reproduce all the calculations in the BSc Thesis Edge Detection on Quantum Chains, presented at Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona on September 2022.

All the codes have been included except for the ones serving plotting purposes. Those codes that are uploaded in Mathematica may have to be downloaded in order to be run. The Square Root Gram Matrices and the POVM elements obtained in this work with the codes are available in https://uab-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/1528024_uab_cat/Em2Jq28lt6FJosC07cHY5dUBsT2B_2RIP9trDvwUD3uVUg?e=qtgk5y
